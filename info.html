    <h1>Archimedes Principle</h1>
    <h2>Definition:-</h2>
    <h4>Archimedes' principle states that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or partially, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces</h4>
    <br>
    
    <h2>Formulae:-</h2>
    <h4>Weight of displaced fluid=weight of object in vacuum-weight of object in fluid</h4>
    <h4>The weight of the displaced fluid is directly proportional to the volume of the displaced fluid <br> The weight of the object in the fluid is reduced, because of the force acting on it, which is called upthrust. <br>In simple terms, the principle states that the buoyant force (Fb) on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object,  or the density (ρ) of the fluid multiplied by the submerged volume (V) times the gravity (g).</h4>
    <h2>F<sub>a</sub> =&rho;gV</h2>
    <h3>where <br>1) F<sub>a</sub>=The buoyant force applied onto the submerged object. <br>2) &rho;=the density of the fluid <br>3) g=acceleration due to gravity.<br>4) V=Volume of displaced fluid</h3>

    <h2>FunFact:-</h2>
    <h4>Archimedes has gone down in history as the guy who ran through the streets of Syracuse shouting "Eureka!" — or "I have it!" in Greek. The story behind that event was that Archimedes was charged with proving that a new crown made for Hieron, the king of Syracuse, was not pure gold as the goldsmith had claimed.</h4>
    <h4>Archimedes thought long and hard but could not find a method for proving that the crown was not solid gold. Soon after, he filled a bathtub and noticed that water spilled over the edge as he got in and he realized that the water displaced by his body was equal to the weight of his body. Knowing that gold was heavier than other metals the crown maker could have substituted in, Archimedes had his method to determine that the crown was not pure gold.</h4>
